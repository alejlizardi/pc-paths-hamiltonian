# Reproducibility artifact

Ancillary files for: *Properly colored paths in the union of two Hamiltonian paths
can have length O(√n)* (Lizardi, June 2026).

Environment used to produce `logs/`: Python 3.14.4, Windows 11, single core; no
external Python dependencies. Total wall-clock to regenerate all Python logs:
about 5 minutes. The C++ tool (`cpp/rho_tool.cpp`) compiles with
`g++ -O2 -fopenmp`; it was used for the exhaustive S_n enumerations (n ≤ 12) and
for independent cross-checks.

## Claim-to-log map (paper Section 7)

| paper item | claim | script | log |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | anchors from the earlier note: ρ(σ_m)=2m+3, ρ(σ*)=10, ρ_min(7)=5, ρ_min(8)=6 | `pc.py`, `search_small.py` | `validate2.log`, `search_small.log` |
| 7.2 | classification of admissible visits of H_{T_b} is exactly (V1)–(V5), even b ≤ 14; M(T_b)=b odd b ≤ 11 | `verify_M.py` (minimal independent verifier, written directly from the admissible-visit/transit-number definition, no shared code) | `verify_M.log` |
| 7.3 | M(T_b)=3 for every even 6 ≤ b ≤ 100; M(T_b)=b for odd b ∈ {7,9,11,13} | `check_all_even.py`, `validate2.py` | `check_all_even.log`, `validate2.log` |
| 7.4 | min over S_b of M(π) = 3 for 4 ≤ b ≤ 9 (full enumeration) | `search_small.py` | `search_small.log` |
| 7.5 | explicit lower-bound path (Proposition "Explicit long path") valid at 7 points incl. (20,20) | `verify_path.py` | `verify_path.log` |
| 7.6 | exact ρ(σ_{a,b}) values up to n = 720 (with reachable-state counts) | `endtoend.py`, `bigtable.py` | `endtoend.log`, `bigtable.log` |
| 7.7 | joint (b(σ), ρ(σ)) distribution over all of S_n, 7 ≤ n ≤ 12 (C++; 479,001,600 permutations at n = 12) | `cpp/rho_tool.cpp` | `exh7.txt` … `exh12.txt` |
| 7.8 | landscape probe (exploratory) | `probe.py` | (exploratory; rerun to reproduce) |
| App. A | trap-chain exact values ρ(σ_C) = 2k+2(L−1) (cross-check at 6 points) | `check_trap.py` | `check_trap.log` |

`MANIFEST.sha256` lists checksums of all code and logs.

## Code inventory

- `pc.py` — reference solvers: ρ(σ) and constrained PC-path search (plain recursive).
- `family.py` — memoized iterative (state-dedup) solvers; the gadget family T_b.
- `inflate.py` — the inflation σ = τ[π_1..π_a]; two-visit invariant.
- `endtoend.py` — exact longest-PC-path search with state dedup (used at scale).
- `verify_M.py` — **minimal independent verifier** (~100 lines, no shared code):
  brute-force enumeration of all admissible visits, directly from the definition.
- `verify_path.py` — mechanical check of the explicit lower-bound path
  (Proposition "Explicit long path: the family is Θ(a+b)").
- `cpp/rho_tool.cpp` — independent C++ implementation from a parallel verification
  effort; source of the exhaustive n ≤ 12 statistics (`exh*.txt`) and of
  cross-checks of the exact values at (a,b) ∈ {(6,8),(5,10),(4,12)} and of the
  trap-family values.

## Algorithm note

The exact search explores the state graph on triples (visited set, current vertex,
last color), each state visited once; no pruning. Exactness is by construction;
cost is the number of reachable states, which the logs report per instance
(57,066 at n = 80; 5,012,186 at n = 600; 7,273,586 at n = 720 for σ_{a,b}). On
unstructured permutations the state space is exponential and the method was used
only for n ≤ 19.
